# COMP10002_Assign2
This is my solution for Assignment 2 of Foundations of Algorithms.

This assignment consisted of creating a Checkers playing bot that uses minimax decision trees (of depth 3) to choose the optimal next move.

Features:
- A terminal display for the current board state
- Feeding board states through text files
- Machine simulation (The AI plays 10 moves from the POV of both players)
